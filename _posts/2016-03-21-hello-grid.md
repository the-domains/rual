# A Sense of Place

# You get out of bed. You stumble clumsily to the bathroom, use the toilet, then walk to the kitchen to brew a cup of coffee and toast some bread. It's not even 6:00 a.m. yet, and you have already traversed three distinct places with different uses and configurations: bedroom, bathroom, and kitchen.Humans---perceptive, self-ambulatory organisms that we are---have a complex, symbiotic relationship with our surroundings. We have senses that allow us to detect where we are at any given moment, and to move around from place to place. We can also change these places to suit our needs. The differences between places play a critical role in how we understand one another and the things we can (or can't) do in each of those places: this is where we get food, this is where we sleep, this is where we defecate. As a result, our ability to perceive and make places has been very important in our evolution as a species, and is deeply ingrained in who we are. Over time, our ability to set apart and reconfigure places for special use has evolved along with us: we have gone from "this is the clearing where we worship" to building Chartres Cathedral in a relatively short amount of time (Figure 4-1).We bring this awareness of place---and the placemaking drive---to information environments as well. When we talk about digital media, we use metaphors that betray a sense of place: we "go" online, "visit" a website,"browse" Amazon.com. Increasingly, these environments are also taking over many of the functions we've traditionally associated with physical places: we meet with our friends in WhatsApp, pay our bills in our bank's website, learn in Khan Academy. As with physical places, we experience them as contexts that differ from one another, supporting different needs.
